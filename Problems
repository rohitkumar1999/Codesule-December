# FIBONACCI MEETS GCD
Let Fib(x) denote the value of fibonacci of x. For example F(1) =1 , F(2) = 1, F(3) = 2 and so on for all x. 
Let GCD(a,b) denote the greatest common divisor of two numbers a and b.
You are given an array A of N integers.
You will be given Q queries of the form L R.
For each query you have to find out the value of GCD ( F(A[L] , FA[L+1]â€¦.. FA[R] ) % mod. 
mod = 10^9+7.


Input Format:
First line : Two integers N and Q. Second line : N space separated integers denoting array A. Next Q lines : Two space separated integers L and R.

Constraints:
1 <= N,Q <= 10^5
1 <= A[i] <= 10^9
1 <= L , R <= N
Output Format:
Output the result of each query in a separate line.
